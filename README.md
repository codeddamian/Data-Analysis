### Part 1 - Build a Data Model for Seven Sages Brewing Company

*  My  mission was to tame the datasets and create an efficient data model for a small brewing company
   that will help them better understand what products are popular — and profitable — so they can make
   smart decisions about what products to prioritize as the company continues to grow. 
*  I was tasked to demonstrate an understanding of core data modeling principles, including the ability to clean, 
   organize and structure data in Power Query, to make a date table, to build a data model with the appropriate relationships and filters,
   and to create a simple report using common visualizations and DAX measures.


### Part 2 - Building a Power BI report for Waggle Using Tableau

* Waggle is a hot new start-up that produces smart devices for pets. Their leading product, the Lapdog collar, has been so successful,
   that the company is considering releasing a similar product for cats called Lapcat and has been testing hundreds of prototypes in the field for the past several months.
Now, the data from those tests has been compiled and Waggle leadership has requested a Power BI report that summarizes key insights comparing Lapcat and Lapdog devices that can be presented to the CEO.
 By the end of the project, I designed a detailed Power BI report with many data visuals that tell the story of how the new Lapcat devices compared to Lapdog collars.


### Part 3 - Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain

* An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. 
  Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. In this project, you will use population
  statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and
  whether there is a correlation between sales and income. Through this project, you will demonstrate the
  ability to use custom M code to import, clean, format, and organize data in Power Query and use custom
  DAX code to analyze data in Power BI. You will also conduct statistical analysis to understand relationships and probabilities
   of the data sources, including linear regression, histogram, and standard deviation, and create advanced visualizations to present
  conclusions and recommendations that are driven by the statistical analysis.
